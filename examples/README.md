## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
- Begin with `basic-config.yaml`
- Test with a small subset of users
- Gradually enable more features

### 2. Test Before Production
- Use a test domain or OU
- Verify alerts work correctly
- Check performance impact

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Start with small batch sizes
- Increase rate limit delay if hitting quotas
- Enable caching for better performance

### 4. Security
- Never commit service account JSON to git
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Rotate credentials regularly

### 5. Incremental Rollout
- Enable one feature at a time
- Monitor for false positives
- Adjust thresholds based on results

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: API Quota Exceeded

**Solution:** Increase `rate_limit_delay` in config:
```yaml
scanning:
  rate_limit_delay: 0.5  # Increase from 0.1
```

### Issue: Too Many False Positives

**Solution:** Increase PII confidence threshold:
```yaml
pii_detection:
  confidence_threshold: 0.7  # Increase from 0.5
```

### Issue: Slow Scans

**Solution:** Enable caching and increase batch size:
```yaml
scanning:
  batch_size: 200  # Increase from 100
  enable_cache: true
```
